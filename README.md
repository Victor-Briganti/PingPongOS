# Ping Pong OS

Ping Pong OS is a educational project aimed at incrementally building a small, toy OS. This experimental operating system focuses on implementing core libraries and system components to deepen comprehension of how an OS functions.

The development of Ping Pong OS will be guided by the resources available at https://wiki.inf.ufpr.br/maziero/doku.php?id=so:pingpongos.
